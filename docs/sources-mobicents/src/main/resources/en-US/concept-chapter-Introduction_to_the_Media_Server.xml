			<title>Media Gateways Bridge Multiple Technologies</title>
			<para>
				Today, computers play an important role in modern communications. Widespread access to broadband Internet and
				the ubiquity of Internet Protocol (
				<acronym>IP</acronym>
				) enable the convergence of voice, data and video. Media
				gateways provide the ability to switch voice media
				between a network and its access point. Using Digital
				Subscriber Line (
				<acronym>DSL</acronym>
				) and fast-Internet cable technology, a media gateway
				converts, compresses and packetizes voice data for
				transmission back-and-forth across the Internet backbone
				for landline and wireless phones. Media gateways sit at
				the intersection of Public Switched Telephone Networks (
				<acronym>PSTN</acronym>
				s) and wireless or IP-based networks.

		<para>
			Media services have played an important role in the
			traditional Time Division Multiplexing (
			<acronym>TDM</acronym>
			)-based telephone network. As the network migrates to an
			Internet Protocol (
			<acronym>IP</acronym>
			)-based environment, media services are also moving to new
			environments.
		</para>
		<para>
			One of the most exciting trends is the emergence and
			adoption of complementary modular standards that leverage
			the Internet to enable media services to be developed,
			deployed and updated rapidly. This is carried out in a network
			architecture that supports the two concepts called
			<emphasis>provisioning-on-demand</emphasis>
			and
			<emphasis>scaling-on-demand</emphasis>
			.

			<para>
				The Media Server's high degree of modularity benefits
				the application developer in several ways. The
				already-tight code can be further optimized to support
				applications that require small footprints. For example,
				if
				<acronym>PSTN</acronym>
				interconnection is unnecessary in an application, then
				the D-channel feature can be removed from the Media Server. In the future, if the same application is
				deployed within a Signaling System 7 (
				<acronym>SS7</acronym>
				) network, then the appropriate endpoint can be enabled,
				and the application is then compatible.

			<para>
				The Media Server architecture assumes that call control
				intelligence lies outside of the Media Server, and is
				handled by an external entity. The Media Server also
				assumes that call controllers will use control
				procedures such as
				<acronym>MGCP</acronym>
				,
				<acronym>MEGACO</acronym>
				or
				<acronym>MSML</acronym>
				, among others. Each specific control module can be
				plugged in directly to the server as a standard
				deployable unit. Utilizing the JBoss Microcontainer for
				the implementation of control protocol-specific
				communication logic allows for simple deployment. It is
				therefore unnecessary for developers to configure
				low-level transaction and state management details,
				multi-threading, connection-pooling and other low-level
				details and
				<acronym>API</acronym>
				s.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Mobicents Media Server call control intelligence can
				be a JSLEE Application deployed on Mobicents JAIN SLEE
				Server or any other JAIN SLEE container. In case of
				Mobicents JSLEE Server there is already MGCP Resource
				Adaptor available.
			</para>

			<para>
				Mobicents Media Server can also be controlled from
				Mobicents SIP Servlets or any other SIP Servlets
				container using any of the above call control procedures
				or using the Mobicents JSR-309 Implementation. Mobicents
				JSR-309 Implementation internally leverages MGCP
				protocol to controll Media Server. Mobicents JSR-309
				implementation details is out of scope of this document.
			</para>

			<para>
				It is also possible to control the Mobicents Media
				Server from any third party Java application (including
				standalone Java apps) or other technologies like .NET
				etc as far as they follow standrad protocols like MGCP,
				MEGACO etc. There is no dependency on call controller
				but the protocol used between the call controller and
				Mobicents Media Server.
			</para>


			<para>
				Many key features of Mobicents Media Server are provided
				by integrating individual components operating using
				generic Service Provider Interface. There are two of
				types of high level components: Endpoints and
				Controllers.
			</para>

			<section id="ittms-Endpoints">
				<title>Endpoints</title>

				<para>
					It is convenient to consider a media gateway as a
					collection of endpoints. An endpoint is a logical
					representation of a physical entity such as an
					analog phone or a channel in a trunk. Endpoints are
					sources or sinks of data and can be either physical
					or virtual. Physical endpoint creation requires
					hardware installation, while software is sufficient
					for creating virtual endpoints. An interface on a
					gateway that terminates at a trunk connected to a
					<acronym>PTSN</acronym>
					switch would be an example of a physical endpoint.
					An audio source in an audio content server would be
					an example of a virtual endpoint.
				</para>

				<para>
					The type of the endpoint determines its
					functionality. From the points considered so far, the following basic endpoint types have been identified:

					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>
					This list is not comprehensive. Other endpoint types may be
					defined in the future, such as test endpoints which
					could be used to check network quality, or
					frame-relay endpoints that could be used to manage
					audio channels multiplexed over a frame-relay
					virtual circuit.

						Descriptions of Various Access Point Types
					</title>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Announcement Server Access Point</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								An announcement server endpoint provides
								access, intuitively, to an announcement
								server. Upon receiving requests from the
								call agent, the announcement server
								<quote>plays</quote>
								a specified announcement. A given
								announcement endpoint is not expected to
								support more than one connection at a
								time. Connections to an announcement
								server are typically one-way; they are
								<quote>half-duplex</quote>
								: the announcement server is not
								expected to listen to audio signals from
								the connection. Announcement access
								points are capable of playing
								announcements; however, these endpoints
								do not have the capability of
								transcoding. To achieve transcoding, a
								Packet Relay must be used. Also note
								that the announcement server endpoint
								can generate tones, such as dual-tone
								multi-frequency (DTMF).
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>
							Interactive Voice Response Access Point
						</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								An Interactive Voice Response (
								<acronym>IVR</acronym>
								) endpoint provides access to an
								<acronym>IVR</acronym>
								service. Upon requests from the call
								agent, the
								<acronym>IVR</acronym>
								server
								<quote>plays</quote>
								announcements and tones, and
								<quote>listens</quote>
								for responses, such as (
								<acronym>DTMF</acronym>
								) input or voice messages, from the
								user. A given
								<acronym>IVR</acronym>
								endpoint is not expected to support more
								than one connection at a time. Similarly
								to announcement endpoints, IVR endpoints
								do not possess media-transcoding
								capabilities. IVR plays and records in
								the format in which the media was stored
								or received.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Conference Bridge Access Point</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								A conference bridge endpoint is used to
								provide access to a specific conference.
								Media gateways should be able to
								establish several connections between
								the endpoint and packet networks, or
								between the endpoint and other endpoints
								in the same gateway. The signals
								originating from these connections are
								mixed according to the connection
								<quote>mode</quote>
								(as specified later in this document).
								The precise number of connections that
								an endpoint supports is characteristic
								of the gateway, and may, in fact, vary
								according to the allocation of resources
								within the gateway.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Packet Relay Endpoint</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								A packet relay endpoint is a specific
								form of conference bridge that typically
								only supports two connections. Packet
								relays can be found in firewalls between
								a protected and an open network, or in
								transcoding servers used to provide
								interoperation between incompatible
								gateways, such as gateways which don't
								support compatible compression
								algorithms and gateways which operate
								over different transmission networks,
								such as IP or ATM.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Echo Endpoint</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								An echo—or loopback—endpoint is a test
								endpoint that is used for maintenance
								and/or continuity testing. The endpoint
								returns the incoming audio signal from
								the endpoint back to that same endpoint,
								thus creating an echo effect

			<section id="ittms-Controller-Modules">
				<title>Controller Modules</title>
				<para>
					Controller Modules allows external interfaces to be
					implemented for the Media Server. Each controller
					module implements an industry standard control
					protocol, and uses a generic SPI to control
					processing components or endpoints.
				</para>
				<para>
					One such controller module is the Media Gateway
					Control Protocol (MGCP). MGCP is designed as an
					internal protocol within a distributed system that
					appears to outside as a single VoIP gateway. The
					MGCP is composed of a Call Agent, and set of
					gateways including at least one "media gateway" that
					perform the conversion of media signal between
					circuit and packets, and at least one "signalling
					gateway" when connecting to an SS7 controlled
					network. The Call Agent can be distributed over
					several computer platforms.
